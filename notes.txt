DISCO 
On the computers in the lab, our test results had a very large range. CPU usage maxed out whenever we ran our tests (hardware bottleneck?). (RESOLVED: Our 
data became consistent after changes to the code were made away from the lab.)
QCC
How many trials is reasonable? How big should our arrays be? (RESOLVED: Since lines of code are relatively tiny, we should be able to run millions of tests w/o experiencing run-time errors.)

GALLERY TOUR
Array starting from length of 1000 up to 20000000
Used not just worst case scenario but also random search
One group had a rainbow name

One group used a while loop that effectively made it so that however many trials it took the binary search to return a significant time figure, that number of trials would be performed for the linear search. This allowed the binary search result to be
significant while also keeping the test results consistent and unbiased.
