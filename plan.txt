#Lab03_BPK Plan
Lin Search vs Bin Search
Make arrays of varying length, randomly generated within some range--i.e 1000-100000
Use built-in currentTimeMillis to time it
Run both searches many times with no outside influence like other programs open
Use average time that it took to run in proportion to how long the array is to compare the two methods
Use "best case" and "worst case" scenarios and figure out which runs better
